We have a complete call center solution, with a visual dial-plan, monitoring tools and reporting, which we plan to release to the public under an open source license.

Please visit [Open Callcenter Survey](http://www.open-callcenter.com/survey.html) to help us decide under which terms we will release the product.

Please visit the [Open Callcenter website](http://www.open-callcenter.com) to learn more about the features and see screenshots of the system.
